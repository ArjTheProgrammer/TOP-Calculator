# The Odin Project Calculator

I created a basic calculator that includes all the fundamental mathematical operations. I applied the concepts taught in The Odin Project's foundation course. Here's what I did:

1. **HTML Structure:**

   - I set up the basic HTML structure for the calculator.
   - Created buttons for digits, operators, and other functionalities.

2. **CSS Styling:**

   - Styled the calculator using CSS to make it visually appealing.
   - Adjusted button sizes, colors, and layout.

3. **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:**
   - Implemented the calculator logic using JavaScript.
   - Captured button clicks and displayed the input on the screen.
   - Performed calculations based on user input.
